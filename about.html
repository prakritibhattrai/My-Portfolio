<h5>ABOUT ME</h5>

<h1>PRAKRITI BHATTARAI</h1>
<h6>Kathmandu,Nepal</h6>
<p class="col-sm-8">I am a digital creative director, designer, and animator originally from Northwest Ohio and based in Los Angeles with over 9 years of experience in the industry. I am a passionate creative that leads by example with a hands-on approach. I believe design is earned. An idea, a concept, a masterpiece is only as powerful as the message it is able to carry. I work alongside my team no matter the situation or limited time to teach. I seek to inspire, and build the best work possible. I am a critical thinker and problem solver that takes a holistic approach to every project, making sure every aspect of it gets produced at the highest quality.

Currently, I lead a growing team in efforts across a variety of advertiser categories / solutions as well as internal marketing efforts as the Group Creative Director at HYFN in Hermosa Beach, California. Over the past two and half years I have helped grow a creative team of less than ten to a team of almost twenty that has produced work for the likes of UFC Gym, HP, Frito-Lay, Sky Zone, Macyâ€™s, and more.

Previously working at Ignition Creative, I helped establish and grow an interactive team from a three-person boutique to one of the world's premiere Interactive Agencies. Over my five years there, I was an integral part of award-winning theatrical campaigns such as UP, Toy Story 3, Fantastic Mr. Fox, Prometheus, and X-Men Days of Future Past. Prometheus and X-Men followed the success of Ignition's work on Hunger Games to set a new standard for theatrical transmedia campaigns, pushing the boundaries of storytelling and original content creation outside traditional marketing efforts.</p>
